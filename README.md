# Page-Replacement-Algorithms
It is required to simulate some paging replacement algorithms. </br>
The required algorithms
to be implemented are as follows:
1. Optimal
2. First In First Out (FIFO)
3. Least Recently Used (LRU)
4. Clock

 </br> </br>
 Your input will be from standard input. Your output will be to standard output. The input
will contain the number of pages allocated to the process, the simulated algorithm
(OPTIMAL, FIFO, LRU, or CLOCK), and then a sequence of page references. The last line in the input is -1 (and is ignored)</br>
For each run, you should print the following:
1. A trace recording page faults for each memory reference in the sequence.
2. Counter recording total page faults</br></br>
 This was assignment 4 in OS course.
